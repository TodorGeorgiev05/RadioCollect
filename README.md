# RadioCollect
One of the most well-known radio streaming websites, https://onlineradiobox.com/bg/?cs=bg.versailles, is functional with the app RadioCollect. RadioCollect downloads a daily (for last 7days) playlist of songs, scans the titles, search songs, and saves them to the computer.

The application is quite simple to use, all you have to do is copy the link of the radio station playlist from the website, put the path to the folder containing your music, and run it.

Python is used to write code.
